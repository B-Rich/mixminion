		- Clean out deleted stuff every so often
		o Configuration stuff should go into servermain/clientmain.
		   Forget this broken system of today.
		o Reset logic should also go into servermain/clientmain.
		o Document changes to Queue, MMTPServer
		. Document and refactor ModuleManager (it needs to know about
                  queues).
		- Make individualized queues into special classes.
		. DeliveryQueue
			- Tests for Queue.*Object*
			o Implement
