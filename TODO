For 0.0.4:
        . UI
                o The error on '-P foo' should be 'path too short',
                  and not mention legs. (neruaL)

                o Beautify list-servers output

                  into header.
                o Ctrl-C should just print "interrupted."

                o KEYID should be hash of signing key==hash of

                o Test frontend
        o Bugfixes
                o "Unexpectedly closed connection" sometimes means 
                  "server not there." Log accordingly.
                o The retry scheduling logic is bogus.
                o Attach debugging log calls to DeliveryQueue.
                - Add more logging code to track fds with MMTPServer.
                - Make sure that deliveryFailed/deliverySucceeded
                  with a nonexistent handle give a warning, and don't
                  simply die.
                - Analyze logic: how can a timeout cause deliveryFailed

1-3                     - Generate new SD's as needed, publish as needed
2.5                     - Somehow test the whole business.
                - Rudimentary directory automation (with trivial pinging)
                        - CGI to receive server descriptors:
1-4                             - replace old ones if superceded, 
                                  reject them if invalid,
                                  and queue them if unrecognized.
2                               - Tests for above
.5-1.5                          - The actual CGI
1                       - Ability to move servers from queue to good-list.

1                               - Tests
                        - Trivial pinger: make a list of servers,
                          check which are up, send 1-hop dummies, see
                          which come back.
.5                              - Get server list

?                       - Design directory liveness format.  Maybe include
                          all servers and "live" list for now?
0.5                     - Code to automatically regenerate directories as
                          needed.
1       - Make "=== BEGIN" stuff comply with openpgp rfc: why rock

4       - Finish all documentation, resolve all XXXX004s
3       - Try out all functionality by hand

Deferred from 0.0.4:
        . UI
                . Good user error reporting strategy; use UIError uniformly.
        - Separate error/other log files. ????
        - Notice when out of disk space, die more cleanly
        - COME UP WITH A REAL TESTING STRATEGY FOR PERFORMANCE AND
           CLI'S AND MULTI-SERVER SITUATIONS.
        - Tests for packet addressed to server with bogus IP.
        - Finish port to Cygwin
        - Full statistics

        - Configurability
                - Put pid and lock and key and queues in different
                  places; coalesce pid and lock.
                - Make all filenames in server config relative to
                  server home, if not absolute.
        - Security:
        	- Password-protect dirserver keys
                - Client queues should be locked. (Aren't they?)
        - Key mgt
                - Consider linewrap protection on server descriptors,
                  if demand warrants.  (None yet.)

Required for "1.0":
         [These features must be in place before we can take the system out
          of alpha.  We'll do a series of point releases between 0.0.1 and
          the first beta.]

        - Better CLIs
                X Add another level of CLI commands. (E.g., mixminion server
                  keygen, etc.)
                - Add a --status-fd option similar to GPG's so that
                  we can be more easily embedded.
        - Key rotation and expiry
                - Document "DELKEYS"

                - Make createPrivateDirs gripe about group-writable parent
                  dirs
        - Performance:
                X Directory servers should cache intermediate
                  information. [Pointless for now: my laptop can validate
                  1400 descriptors in 10 seconds.]

                - MBOX

                        - Support for setting 'Subject' line.  (Maybe
                          content-type, too?)
                        - Support multiple exit addresses. (cc, bcc, etc.)
                          Needs to be bandwidth-limited.
                - Incoming email gateway
                        - Insert encoded packet into net.
                        - Reply to a reply block
                        - "Anonymize" is  ("Is?" Is what?)
                - Some notion of 'client modules' would be a good idea.

                - Support for one-side-only MMTP configurations.
                - Add 'ALLOW' lines to blacklist.
                . Freak out properly on missing/unpublishable IP.
                - Make listening configurable for multiple ports/ips, not
                  all of which need be published.  Perhaps allow different
                  rules for each listener. ???? Maybe not really a good idea.
                . Full validation function for client
                . Full validation function for server
                - Ability to disable directory paranoia.
        - Client support
                - Support to remove servers from imported set, or to block
                  servers from directory.
                o Check paths before reading from stdin.
                - Avoid timing distinguishability attack related to
                  check-dir, gen-path, read-from-stdin: only download
                  directory *AFTER* reading?  Strongly recommend a cron job?
                  Write the whole thing off as not-really-an-attack?
                - Some way to read a reply block *and* a message from stdin?
                - Path selection
                        - Watch out for servers that are really the
                          same server
                        - Only pick from the directory when picking
                          random servers.
                        - Notice Allow/Deny.

                - Real PKI for end-to-end encryption
        - MMTP / async
                - Timeout connections more aggressively under higher load.
                - Bandwidth throttling
                X Session management and resumption (security issues?)  Is this
                  really useful for performance?
                        X Server code to find out if clients have renegotiated.

                - Consider linewrap protection on server descriptors,
                  if demand warrants.  (None yet.)
                - Servers should download directories
                - Servers should use downloaded directories to print useful
                  nicknames for other servers rather than just IP addresses.
        - Full documentation
                - Complete docs for all code, with comments and examples.
                - Write guide for module developers
                - Write complete user's manual
                - Complete all other docs
                - History.
        - Cosmetic changes
                - Perhaps "SMTP" should be renamed to "MAIL".

Unspecified:
        [We don't have any specification for this functionality, or any
         mandate to include it in 1.0.  If it's specified before 1.0 is
         done, however, it should go in.]

        - Generate link padding
        - Generate dummy messages
        - IPv6 support.
        - Support for multiple directory servers
        - Notice active attacks and block IPs dynamically.

WHEN WE GET THE CHANCE:
        [This stuff could be for any version 1.0 or later; it's not a
         requirement for 1.0.]
        - License-friendliness:
                - Switch from OpenSSL to NSS or GNUTLS
        - GUI
        . Multithreaded design to scale to multiple CPUs
        - Security
                - Memlockall wrapper
                o Generic secure delete
                - Support for loopback fs automation and shredding.
        - Portability
                - Server running on windows.
        - Time the rest of the system
        - Make DB module choice configurable?
        - Consider dropping support for older Python versions?
