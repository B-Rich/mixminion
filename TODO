NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN:

For 0.0.5.something:
        o Get limited client timeouts working.

For 0.0.6:  (The release for integrators, Windows users, senders of
large replies, people with dynamically assigned IPs, people with high
TCP latency, and me.)
        o Infrastructure -- low level
                o Generic 'encrypted storage' abstraction for
                  possibly-encrypted singleton pickled objects.
                        o Implement
                        o Integrate

                o Don't remove currently-undeliverable messages from client
                  queue when flushing.

        o Dynamic IP support
                o Change IPv4/IPv6 delivery methods to use DNS if desired.
                  [Migration plan: Supplement 'IP' with 'Hostname' in
                   ServerInfo.  If we're routing S1->S2, and both have
                   'Hostname', use FWD/HOST.  Else use FWD/IPv4.  In 0.0.7,
                   drop FWD/IPv4 support, and remove IP from ServerInfo.]
                        o Rename *FWD_TYPE to FWD_IPV4_TYPE

                        o Path generation changes
                                o Implement stub canRelayTo and getRoutingFor
                                  in ServerInfo.
                                o Design functionality for can-i-relay-to and

                                o Test
        o Infrastructure -- high level
                o Separate directory downloading, directory caching, path
                  parsing, and path generation into a new module.
                o Separate SURB logging, keystores, and client queues into
                  client support module.
                o Refactor path selection to have a nicer interface.
                        X Generic, cross-module notion of "address".
                        X Better capability infrastructure.
                        o Better ExitAddress notion.
                        o Separate parsing path str into specifier list, 
                          checking specifier list for sanity, and generating
                          path from specifier list.

                  thing with multi-packet messages
                        o Write the code
                        o Hand-test multi-packet and single-packet fwd
                          messages and replies.
        o Security

                o Only warn about unknown types once.
                o Timeouts should say 'timeout', not EINTR.
                o Timeouts should be user-configurable.
                D Logging UIErrors isn't a bad idea.
                o Make UIErrors _look_ like log messages when they hit the
                  console.
                D Separate 'mixminiond' wrapper; 'mixminion server-foo'
                  confuses folk.
                o SSL's "Unexpected error: wrong version number"
                  message is confusing.
                o Better error message when opening db with unsupported
                  database type.
                o List servers by nickname, not by IP (partial solution for
                  clients only, but make expandable to servers once they
                  download directories.)
                D List servers by nickname, not by IP, even in server logs.
                o Make TRACE mode less verbose, or make DEBUG mode more
                  useful.

                        o Make sure Maximum-Size and Allow-From are obeyed
                          for all types

                - SIGHUP should reconfigure everything:
                        - Logs
                        - EventStats

                  places; coalesce pid and lock.
                - Make all filenames in server config relative to
                  server home, if not absolute.
                X Make zlib bomb prevention configurable.
                - Separate error/other log files.
                - Make SURB logging configurable.
                - Add 'ALLOW' lines to blacklist.
        - Client support
                - Some way to read a reply block *and* a message from
                stdin?
        - Directory support
                - Servers should download directories
                - Servers should use downloaded directories to print useful
                  nicknames for other servers rather than just IP addresses.
        - Port to Twisted, if reasonable (see HACKING)
        - Send/receive large messages without having to suck them all
          into RAM at once.
                - Fragment and unfragment large messages on disk.
        - MMTP / async
               - Tests for all cases:
                        - Packet to server with bogus IP
                        - Junk
                        - Retry on bogus close.
                        - Multiple senders
                        - Bad senders
                        - Bad recipients
                        - Hunt down leaks

Features for "1.0" (some research/specification required):
        - Nymservers
        - Modules and module support
                - Incoming email gateway
                        - Insert encoded packet into net.
                        - Reply to a reply block
        - Configurability
                - Make listening configurable for multiple ports/ips, not
                  all of which need be published.  Perhaps allow different
                  rules for each listener. ???? Maybe not really a good idea.
        - Client support: Improved path selection
                - Figure out how to deal with non-clique topologies
                - Watch out for servers that are really the
                  same server
                - Only pick from the directory when picking
                  random servers.
                - Notice Allow/Deny.
                - Notice MMTP protocol versions.
        - UI issues
                - Notice when out of disk space, die more cleanly.
                  (support max-disk-usage).
        - Dynamic IP support
                - Servers redirect to latest IP if old IP is down.  (Dynamic
                  IP support, after a fashion.)
        - Client support: other
                - Send message to user with known public key
                - Real PKI for end-to-end encryption
        - Directories
                - Support for full-blown multiple-server agreement mechanism
        - IPv6 support (must solve non-clique problem)
        - Generate link padding (if it helps)
        - Notice active attacks and block IPs dynamically.
        - Abuse prevention of some undetermined kind.


WHEN WE GET THE CHANCE:
        [This stuff could be for any version 1.0 or later; it's not a
         requirement for 1.0.]
        - License-friendliness:
                - Switch from OpenSSL to NSS or GNUTLS
        - GUI
        . Multithreaded design to scale to multiple CPUs
        - Security
                - Memlockall wrapper
                o Generic secure delete
                - Support for loopback fs automation and shredding.
        - Make DB module choice configurable?
        - Consider dropping support for older Python versions?
