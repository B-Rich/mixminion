			o Backend
			o Integrated server list management
			o Tests for backend
			o CLI supprot
			- Tests for new server lists
			- Tests for CLI
		o Server-side directory generation (not automated;
	          still no automatic rotation.)

	. Minimal DOS prevention
		!- SMTP-address blacklisting (for SMTP module)
		o Prevent bogus nicknames from bombing server.
		o Prevent zlib bombing: minimal version.

	- Add another level of CLI commands. (E.g., mixminion server
	  keygen)?
	o Correct README to mention: no 'make build'.
	o Correct mixminiond.conf to mention that ~ must be mode 0700.
	o Fix Makefile to work on FreeBSD.

	  mixing with a medium-long interval.
	  	o Implement
		o Tests for configuration

		o Add examples to mixminiond.conf
	o Refactor main loop to be event based
	o Balance =-signs on "==ANONYMOUS MESSAGE BEGINS"
	!- Acknowledgments
	!- History.

	- Document everything
	- Make __version__ get set automatically, from only one place.
	- Write a "whatsnew".

Required for "1.0":
	 [These features must be in place before we can take the system out
          of alpha.  We'll do a series of point releases between 0.0.1 and
          the first beta.  The first three priorities are: replies,
  	  DOS-prevention, and directories.]

	- Better CLIs
		- Actual strategy for reporting exceptions vs
	   	  user-visible errors.
	- Key rotation and expiry
		- Automatic keygen as needed

		  unreliable.

			- Support multiple exit addresses.
		- Incoming email gateway
		o Refactor module manager to do decoding _before_ passing

		  all of which need be published.  Perhaps allow different
		  rules for each listener.
		. Full validation function for client
		. Full validation function for server
		- Ability to disable directory paranoia.
		- Make 'push' and 'retry' delivery rates independant and
		  module-adjustable
