For 0.0.3:
        - Client
                - Client support for reply blocks.
                - Faster (adjustable?) timeout on client connect failure.
        - Multithreaded server for better network behavior (no 10ms
          hiccups when receiving; no pauses to shred files or deliver
          messages.)
                . Make all C functions use Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS and
                  Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS properly.
                - Make all commonly used Python code threadsafe.
                - Make Queues threadsafe.
                        - Design
                        - Implement
                        - Unit tests like mad.
                - Make shredding happen in a separate thread.
                - Make delivery happen in a separate thread.
                - Make packet happen in a separate thread. 
        - Signals
                - Cleaner shutdown on TERM.
                - Good reset handling
        - Support (for the alpha cycle only!) to get the mixminion
          version remotely ????
        - Saner retry logic: right now we retry once at each of the 10
          next Mix intervals, regardless of interval length.
        - Statistics of some kind
        - UI
                - Good user error reporting strategy.
                - Better error message when path+routinginfo won't fit 
                  into header.
                - Beautify list-servers output.
                o Make path parsing accept space around the commas and colon.
                o Make paths print more cleanly.
                o Better command breakdown for pulling directories.

                - Ability to notice discrepancies between SD and
                  server configuration.
                - Consider linewrap protection on server descriptors, 
                  if demand warrants.
        - Build/install:
                . Uninstall support?
        - Security:
        	- Password-protect dirserver keys
        - Configurability
                - Put pid and lock and key and queues in different places.
                - Relative paths all throughout config files.
                - Make all filenames in server config relative to
                  server home, if not absolute.
                - Make server gripe loudly when config doesn't match published
                  serverinfo.
        - MMTP
                - Code to send junk (connection padding)
                  [Do current servers even handle this right?  Should
                   we bump the MMTP version up?]

                - Session managment and resumption (security issues?)
        - COME UP WITH A REAL TESTING STRATEGY

         [These features must be in place before we can take the system out
          of alpha.  We'll do a series of point releases between 0.0.1 and
          the first beta.]

                . Full validation function for client
                . Full validation function for server
                - Ability to disable directory paranoia.
