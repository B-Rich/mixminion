NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN:

For 0.0.6:  (The release for integrators, Windows users, senders of
large replies, people with dynamically assigned IPs, people with high
TCP latency, and me.)
        - Infrastructure -- low level
                - Generic 'encrypted storage' abstraction for
                  possibly-encrypted singleton pickled objects.

                - Switch from OpenSSL to NSS or GNUTLS
