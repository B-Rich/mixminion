NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN

FOR 0.0.1: (The first alpha)
	[Requirements: hackers can use this system to try sending messages
         around.  At least one delivery method works.  The code may be
         DOS'able, but must not have remote exploits.  Dirservers need not
         work.  There need not be an interface for replies.  Key rotation
         need not be automated.]

	. Server
		o Fix bug: delivering self->self.
		- More explicit overview of queues.
		- Unit tests for various queues.
		- Test code to start 3 or 4 servers on one machine and
                  try sending some messages through.
	*. CLI client
		o Send a message
		o Linkage from command line to helper class
		o Design directory layout
		o Storage for serverinfo
			o Make serverinfo pickleable
				o Make RSA pickleable
			o Test
		o Test 'address'.
		o Check whether exit host supports delivery method
		o Make address support 0xhex:string
		- Unit tests for MixminionClient
		*. Test CLI client
		- Document it all
	. Build
		- Use sane arguments when testing with multiple python versions
		- Marginal 'make install'
		- Marginal 'make dist'
	- Integration testing
		- Better log messages at all points throughout system.
		. Fake delivery module for MBOX-less testing of core
			*. Test fake delivery module
		- Automated tests for several servers running on one machine.
		- Tests for servers on several different machines.
	. MBox module
		o Implement
		. Test
		        o Unit tests
			- Try it out
	. SMTP-Via-Mixmaster module
		o Implement
		o Implement address validation so we don't get into trouble.
		- Document
		. Test
		        o Unit tests
			- Try it out
	- Refactor.
	        D Rename 'tag' -> 'decoding handle'.
		o Make tag a separate field rather than a prefix of 'exitInfo'
			o Implement.
			o Tests for new members of subheader.
		o Move decoding logic into ModuleManager from modules.
		- Move exit types and addresses into Packet.py?
		- Disable 'non-state-carrying' reply blocks.  Rename 'stateful'
		  (non-state-carrying) and 'stateless' (state-carrying) to
		  something less contradictory
		- Triage XXXX, FFFF, ???? for 0.0.1
	- Final license
	- Documentation
		- Contributor's guide
		- Basic HOWTO
		- Difference between XXXX FFFF ????
		- Overall design
	- Patch specification:
	  	- SPEC comments from code
		- Incorporate e2e mixminion design
		- Rename stateful, stateless SURBs
	- Separate package for server code.

Required for "1.0":
	 [These features must be in place before we can take the system out
          of alpha.  We'll do a series of point releases between 0.0.1 and
          the first beta.]

	- Key rotation and expiry
		- Automatic keygen as needed
		- Automatic key rotation
		- Password-protected private identity keys
		- Password-protected private link/packet keys
	- Security
		- Make createPrivateDirs gripe about group-writable parent
		  dirs
		- Make hashlog code use journaling if underlying dbs are
		  unreliable.
	- Server core
		- Clean shutdown
		- Good reset handling
		- Drop undeliverable messages in a sane way
	- Modules and module support
		- MBOX
			- Use async or threading to cope with blocking MTAs
			- Full config validation
			- Full boilerplate
		- Move boilerplate into outside files.  Add a generic
		  'Boilerplate' functionality.
		- Tell ModuleManager about async code
		- Support for forking delivery
		- Real SMTP module
			- Abuse prevention
			- Support for setting 'Subject' and 'From' lines.
			- Support multiple exit addresses.
		- Incoming email gateway
		- Refactor module manager to do decoding _before_ passing
		  payloads to the individual module implementations.
		- Some notion of 'client modules' would be a good idea.
		- Put 'address' someplace more reasonable.
	- End-to-end issues
	        - K-of-N fragmentation and reassembly
		- Cap output size to prevent zlib bombing
	- Configurablity
	  	- Support for one-side-only MMTP configurations.
		- Make Mix algorithm configurable
		o Infer server IP
		. Freak out properly on missing/unpublishable IP.
		- Make listening configurable for multiple ports/ips, not
		  all of which need be published.  Perhaps allow different
		  rules for each listener.
		- Full validation function for client
		- Full validation function for server
		- Make 'push' and 'retry' delivery rates independant and
		  module-adjustable
		- Make 'drop undeliverable' rate configurable.
		- Implement allow/deny code
		- Make server gripe loudly when config doesn't match published
		  serverinfo.
	- Client support
	  	- Generate (but don't send) a message
		- Generate a reply block
		- Read message from reply block
		- Path selection
			- Understand differing server features
			- Watch out for servers that are really the
			  same server
		- Reply to reply block
		- Examine reply block
		- Send message to user with known key
		- Send message to user with known server
		- Real server directory management
		- Real PKI
	        - Queue a bunch of messages at the client level.

	 mandate to include it in 1.0.  If it's specified before 1.0 is
	 done, however, it should go in.]

	- Generate link padding
	- Generate dummy messages

WHEN WE GET THE CHANCE:
	[This stuff could be for any version 1.0 or later; it's not a
 	 requirement for 1.0.]
	- License-friendliness:
		- Switch from OpenSSL to NSS or GNUTLS
	- GUI
	- Multithreaded design to scale to multiple CPUs
	- Security
		- Memlockall wrapper
		- Generic secure delete
		- Support for loopback fs automation and shredding.
	- Portability
		- Server running on windows.
	- Time the rest of the system
