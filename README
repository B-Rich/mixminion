HOW TO BUILD, TEST, AND INSTALL MIXMINION: The quick version.
  % cd Mixminion-0.0.1
  % make download-openssl
  % make build-openssl
  % make
  % make test
  % su
  Password:
  # make install

HOW TO BUILD, TEST, AND INSTALL MIXMINION: The verbose version.
  1) You must have Python version 2.0 or later installed on your system.  The
     binary may be called "python", "python2", "python2.X", or something else.
     If you don't have Python >=v2.0, go install it.  You can find source and
     binary distributions at http://www.python.org/.

  2) If you have OpenSSL version 0.9.7beta3 or later, go to step 4.
     Otherwise, continue.

  3) Run "make download-openssl".

  4) Run "make build-openssl".  If this step fails, OpenSSL didn't build
     correctly on your system.  Go read contrib/openssl/INSTALL, and make
     OpenSSL build.

  5) Run "make build".  If you get any errors, please report them to 
     <mixminion-devel@freehaven.net>.

  6) Run "make test" to run Mixminion's unit tests.  If you get any errors,
     please replort them to <mixminion-devel@freehaven.net>.

  7) Run "make install" to install Mixminion.  You may need to be root to
     execute this command.  By default, Mixminion will install itself relative
     to your python distribution.  If you want to install somewhere else (e.g.
     /home/mixminiond/), run "make install PREFIX=/home/mixminiond".

     A script called "mixminion" will be created in the 'bin' directory
     relative to your prefix, or in the same directory as the python
     executable if no prefix is provided.  To make sure that everything was
     installed correctly, you can run "mixminion unittests".

HOW TO SEND AN EMAIL MESSAGE VIA MIXMINION:
 [First time only. These steps won't be necessary once v0.0.2 is out.]
   1) Download the latest directory from 
         http://www.mixminion.net/miniondir.tar.gz
   2) Unpack it into your homedir; it will create the directory 
         "~/.mixminion/servers/".

 [All subsequent times. The first two steps won't be necessary once v0.0.2 is
    out.]
   1) Check out your list of servers: run 'mixminon list-servers'.
   2) Decide on a two-part path.  Each part of the path must be a comma-
      separated list of servers.  The last server in the second part of the
      path must support smtp.  All intermediate servers must support 'relay'.
   3) Run (type this as a single line):
         mixminion client -t <email address> 
              --path1=<first part of your path>
	      --path2=<second part of your path>
	      -i <filename to send, or - to read from stdin>.

      Example:
         mixminion client -t nosuchuser@mixminion.org --path1=server1,server9 \
              --path2=server5,server10 -i /etc/motd

HOW TO RUN YOUR OWN MIXMINION SERVER:
   1) Create your own mixminiond.conf based on "etc/mixminiond.conf" from the
      mixminion distribution.
   2) Edit mixminiond.conf to refer to your own setup.
   3) Run your server for the first time:
        "mixminion server -f <path to mixminiond.conf>"
   4) {This step will change in future version once directories are supported.}

      For clients to use your server, they'll need a copy of your server 
      descriptor, which should be stored in $SERVER_HOME/keys/key_*/ServerDesc.
      For example, if your mixminiond.conf contains the following line:
           Homedir: /home/mixminion/spool
      
      Then your first server descriptor will be stored in 
            "/home/mixminion/spool/keys/key_0001/ServerDesc".

      Clients should place a copy of this file, named whatever you like,
      in their "~/.mixminion/servers" directory.

      To get your server advertised to the rest of the world, please
      send it to XXXXemail.
