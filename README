I. OVERVIEW
===========

Mixminion is the standard implementation of the Type III anonymous remailer
protocol, which lets you send very anonymous email.  This best-of-breed
remailer uses conservative design approaches to provide security against most
known attacks.  We chose a simple, extensible design so that we can provide a
robust core system and then experiment with new research features such as
dummy policies, directory servers, and reputation systems.

You can find the latest information at http://mixminion.net/, or on the
mailing list, archived at http://archives.seul.org/mixminion/dev/.  Please
consider subscribing, especially if you're going to run a node.

This is a testing alpha release.  You will probably only want to use it if
you are technically inclined, curious, and interested in helping the
Mixminion development effort.

WARNING!  Do NOT use this release if you require strong anonymity.  It has
known deficiencies, including some that make it possible for an adversary
to trace your message through the system.

II. WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION?
===============================

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.5:
   - Fix a harmless but hard-to-detect bug that showed up when running
     unittests on certain platforms.

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.5rc2:
   - Fix for a bug that would crash exit servers trying to upgrade from
     certain older versions.

   - Improved error messages for several cases.

   - Add a draft man page (credit goes to George Danezis).

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.5rc1:
   - Support for email headers.  'Subject', 'In-Reply-To', and 'References'
     are fully supported.  'From' support is limited, as documented in
     'E2E-spec.txt'.

   - Limited support for K-of-N message fragmentation and reassembly.  Right
     now, clients can send large fragmented messages for servers to
     reassemble them.  Not yet supported are independent paths, fragmented
     reply messages, and client-side fragment reassembly.

   - UI improvements
      - Path generation can now create random-length paths
      - Support for removing old messages from client queues.
      - 'Mixminion shell' command to wrap other commands on platforms with
        iffy terminals or shells.  Poor substitute for a real GUI.

   - Improved portability
      - All client and server functionality works properly on Cygwin.
      - Everything should work on win32 too.  (But it won't be supported till
        I can get Py2Exe working.)
      - The build system should work on more unixes.

   - Improved configurability
      - Support for suppressing directory permission messages.

   - Improved performance
      - Server RAM usage should be way down, except while reassembling large
        messages.

   - Improved testability
      - Server descriptors now describe the server's platform and
        configuration. 

   - Bugfixes too numerous to mention.  Server pools in general should be
     significantly more robust.

<See HISTORY file for changes in earlier versions.>

STILL NOT IN THIS VERSION:
   - There's a man page, but it's not included yet because I want it to
     work cross-platform.  
   - IP-based restrictions don't work.
   - No support for distributed directories.
   - Other stuff too numerous to mention; see TODO.

III. HOW TO UPGRADE FROM MIXMINION 0.0.4
========================================

First, follow the installation instructions from section IV to install the
new version of the software.

If you're running a server, you may need to upgrade your configuration file.
Follow these steps:

    1. Your configuration file may be out of date.  The following options
       are new (but not required):
          "FileParanoia"
          "TrusedUser"
          "MaximumSize"
          "FromTag"

       There is a new configuration section "[Delivery/Fragmented]"; add this
       section if you want your server to unfragment and deliver large
       messages.

       See etc/mixminiond.conf for an example.

    2. Start your server as usual ('mixminion server-start') and try sending
       some messages through it.

IV. HOW TO INSTALL MIXMINION
============================

The quick version.
------------------
  <download and unpack http://www.mixminion.net/dist/Mixminion-0.0.5.tar.gz>

  % cd Mixminion-0.0.5
  % make download-openssl
  % make build-openssl
  % make
  % make test
 EITHER:
    % su
    Password:
    # make install
 OR:
    % make install PREFIX=~

The verbose version.
--------------------

  1) You must have Python version 2.0 or later installed on your system.  The
     binary may be called "python", "python2", "python2.X", or something else.
     If you don't have Python >=v2.0, go install it.  You can find source and
     binary distributions at http://www.python.org/.

  2) If you have OpenSSL version 0.9.7beta3 or later, go to step 5.
     Otherwise, continue.

  3) Run "make download-openssl".

  4) Run "make build-openssl".  If this step fails, OpenSSL didn't build
     correctly on your system.  Go read contrib/openssl/INSTALL, and make
     OpenSSL build.

  5) Run "make".  If you don't get any error messages, go to step 6.

     If you have OpenSSL 0.9.7 installed, but the build script doesn't find
     it, you can force it to look in a particular location (say, "/home/ssl")
     with:
            make OPENSSL_PREFIX=/home/ssl
     This will make the scripts look for headers in $OPENSSL_PREFIX/include
     and libraries in $OPENSSL_PREFIX/lib.

     If the scripts *still* can't find OpenSSL 0.9.7, you can override the
     compile and link options directly, like this:
            make OPENSSL_CFLAGS='-I/home/ssl/include' \
                 OPENSSL_LDFLAGS='-L/home/ssl/libraries -lssl097 -lcrypto097'

     If your C compiler knows where to find OpenSSL on its own, but the
     build script doesn't trust it, you can disable searching like this:
            make SKIP_OPENSSL_SEARCH=y

     If you get any other errors, please report them to <nickm@freehaven.net>.

  6) Run "make test" to run Mixminion's unit tests.  If you get any errors,
     please report them to <nickm@freehaven.net>.

  7) Run "make install" to install Mixminion.  You may need to be root to
     execute this command.  By default, Mixminion will install itself relative
     to your python distribution.  If you want to install somewhere else (e.g.
     /home/miniond/), run "make install PREFIX=/home/miniond".

     A script called "mixminion" will be created in the 'bin' directory
     relative to your prefix, or in the same directory as the python
     executable if no prefix is provided.  To make sure that everything was
     installed correctly, you can run "mixminion unittests".

V. HOW TO SEND MESSAGES VIA MIXMINION
=====================================

Just run one of the following command lines:

        mixminion send -t <email address> -i <filename to send>
    OR  mixminion send -t <email address>            (to read from stdin)
    OR  mixminion send -t <email address> -i -       (also reads from stdin)

Mixminion will then take the following steps:

     A) Download and validate the latest server directory.
        (But only if you haven't done so since midnight GMT.)
     B) Select a path that ends at a server with SMTP support.
        (Currently, this defaults to 4 hops.)
     C) Read your message.
     D) Construct a Type III Mix packet containing your message.
        (For more information, see the links at http://www.mixminion.net/)
     E) Send the message to the first server in your path.

To specify headers, use any of the following options:

      --subject=<subject line to use>
      --in-reply-to=<in-reply-to line to use>
      --references=<references line to use>
      --from=<from address to use>

      All are used verbatim, except for 'from', which the exit server wraps
      in an envelope to indicate that the address is anonymous.  For example,
      if you specify --from="Tristero", your recipient will get an email that
      says something like "From: "[Anon] Tristero" <nobody@remailer>".

To see a list of currently known servers, type:

      mixminion list-servers

To force a reload of the server directory, type:

      mixminion send -t <address> [-i <file>] -D yes

To send a message _without_ reloading the directory, type:

      mixminion send -t <address> [-i <file>] -D no

To reload the directory without sending a message, type:

        mixminion send -D yes
     OR mixminion update-servers

To see whether a server is running, type:
 
      mixminion ping <servername>

      (WARNING: This command is potentially dangerous, for a number of subtle
      and not-so-subtle reasons.  It will go away before Mixminion 1.0.)

To force a path of a given length, type:

      mixminion send -t <address> [-i <file>] -H <number of hops>

      You can change the default number of hops by editing ~/.mixminionrc

To specify a path manually, type:

      mixminion send -t <address> [-i <file>] -P <path>

      The argument <path> must be a comma separated list of either:
          (a) Server nicknames as given by 'list-servers'
          (b) Paths to files containing server descriptors [more info below]

      For example, to send a message through the servers Foo, Bar, Baz, and
      Quux, you would type "-P Foo,Bar,Baz,Quux."

      To specify a randomly chosen server, you can include a question mark,
      like this:
             -P 'Foo,?,Bar,?'     [Foo, a random server, Bar, and another
                                   random server]

      You can specify a sequence of N random servers like this:
             -P 'Foo,*3,Bar'      [Foo, three random servers, then Bar.]

      You can specify a random-length sequence of *about* N servers like
      this:
             -P 'Foo,~3,Bar'      [Foo, about three random servers, then Bar.]

      If you have specified a path length (explicitly or in ~/.mixminionrc)
      you can use a '*' to indicate as many random servers as are needed to
      make your path long enough:

             -P 'Foo,*'           [Path that starts with Foo]
             -P '*,Foo'           [Path that ends with Foo]
             -P 'Foo,Bar,*,Quux'  [Path that starts with Foo and Bar,
                                   and ends with Quux]

      {ADVANCED} By default, the swap point will be halfway through
      the path (rounding up). To specify a swap point explicitly, use
      a colon in your path, as in:
             -P 'Foo,Bar:Baz,Quux'    [Swap headers at server Bar]
             --swap-at=<n>            [Swap headers at the n'th server]
      If you don't know what a swap point is, don't worry. :)

If you want to use the same path by default for all of your messages,
edit the  ~/.mixminionrc and change the ForwardPath line:

      # By default, use the same servers for entry and exit each time,
      # with about three randomly chosen servers in the middle.
      ForwardPath: FavoriteEntry,~3,FavoriteExit

To send a dummy message, specify "drop" instead of an email address, as in:

      mixminion send -t drop
      mixminion send -t drop -P '*,Foo'
      mixminion send -t drop -H 8

To queue a message for later transmission, run "mixminion queue" instead of
"mixminion send":

      mixminion queue -t <address> -i <file> -P <path>

      To see all the packets waiting in the queue:
      
      mixminion inspect-queue

      To attempt to deliver all messages waiting in the queue:

      mixminion flush

      To attempt to deliver no more than 16 messages:

      mixminion flush -n 16

      To remove messages that have been waiting in the queue for more than
      seven days:

      mixminion clean-queue -d 7

      (QUEUE NOTE: By default, when "mixminion send" fails to deliver a
      message, it leaves that message in the queue to be reattempted later.
      To suppress this behavior, use the "--no-queue" option:
            mixminion send --no-queue -t <address> -i <file> -P <path>
      Also, as a final side note, "mixminion send --queue" is a synonym for
      "mixminion queue".)

To decode a message you have received, type:

      mixminion decode -i <input-file> -o <output-file>.

      Or, to send output to stdout:

      mixminion decode -i <input-file>

      (When you receive a message with non-printing characters via email, it
      will be encoded in base64 before delivery.  When you receive a reply,
      its contents will be encrypted.  The "mixminion decode" command
      extracts the original text from either kind of message as best it can.)

To generate a reply block, type:

      mixminion generate-surb -t <your-address>

      To send the reply block to a file, instead of to stdout:

      mixminion generate-surb -t <your-address> -o <filename>

      If you specify a "SURBAddress" field in ~/.mixminionrc, you may
      omit the target address:

      mixminion generate-surb

      Also, you can control path selection in the same way as with
      sending messages:

      mixminion generate-surb -H 3        (a 3-hop path)
      mixminion generate-surb -P '*,Foo'  (end with server foo)
      mixminion generate-surb -P 'Bar,*'  (start with server bar)

      You can use the '-n' option to generate many reply blocks at once:
      
      mixminion generate-surb -n 100      (generate 100 reply blocks)

      To save space, you can specify binary (as opposed to text) encoding
      for your reply blocks:

      mixminion generate-surb -b -o <filename>

      By default, the client will choose servers to make sure that your
      reply blocks will still function for 7 days.  To choose a different
      lifetime:
         mixminion generate-surb --lifetime=1           (1 day)
      Note that if you choose an overlong lifetime, there may not be enough
      servers whose keys will be valid for the entire period.

      If you maintain multiple pseudonymous identities, to avoid a
      SURB-swapping attack, you should use the --identity option so that
      you can later see which messages were to sent to which SURB identity.
         mixminion generate-surb --identity=alice -o alices_surb
         mixminion generate-surb --identity=bob   -o bobs_surb

Once you have a reply block for a user, you can send reply messages by
typing:

      mixminion send -R <reply-block-filename> -i <input-filename>

      The other options to 'send' and 'pool' still apply; the reply block
      takes the place of the destination address:
         mixminion send -R <reply-block>          (Read from stdin)
         mixminion send -R <reply-block> -D yes   (Reload directory)
         mixminion send -R <reply-block> -H 4     (Use 4 hops before reply.)
         mixminion send -R <reply-block> -P 'Z,*' (Start with server "Z".)
         mixminion pool -R <reply-block>          (Pool the message.)

      IMPORTANT: Mixminion reply blocks can only be used once!  (Thus,
      SURB="Single Use Reply Block".)  The program will remember which
      reply blocks it has used in the past, but if you give a single reply
      block to 2 users, it will only work for one of them, once.

      As a convenience, if you have a file containing many reply blocks,
      you can use it with '-R': the client will choose the first reply
      block from the file which has not expired, and which you have not
      yet used.

      To inspect the reply blocks in a file, you can run:
         mixminion inspect-surbs <filename>
 
If you need to use a proxy server to use the web you can specify it using the
http_proxy environment variable:

      export http_proxy=http://proxy:3128/
      mixminion send -D yes


VI. HOW TO RUN YOUR OWN MIXMINION SERVER
========================================

1) Create a copy of the "etc/mixminiond.conf" file from the
   mixminion distribution and place it where you like.  Mixminion will
   automatically look in ~/.mixminiond.conf, ~/etc/mixminiond.conf, and
   /etc/mixminiond.conf.  However, you can store it anywhere.

2) Edit mixminiond.conf to reflect your own system settings.

3) Run your server for the first time:

        "mixminion server-start -f <path to mixminiond.conf>"

    (The -f flag and path are only necessary if you placed the
    configuration file somewhere other than ~/.mixminiond.conf,
    ~/etc/mixminiond.conf, or /etc/mixminiond.conf.)

5) To try out your server, clients will need a copy of your server
   descriptor, whose location is stored $SERVER_HOME/current-desc.

   For example, if your mixminiond.conf contains the following line:

           Homedir: /home/mixminion/spool

   Then if you read the contents of /home/mixminion/spool/current-desc,
   you will find a filename like:

           "/home/mixminion/spool/keys/key_0001/ServerDesc".

   This file is your current server descriptor.

   Mixminion supports a global directory of server descriptors.  Until you
   are listed in that directory, clients can import your ServerDesc file
   (if they have a copy) by hand by running:

           mixminion import-server <filename>

   They can also use your ServerDesc without importing it by using the
   filename as a part of their path:

           mixminion send -t <address> -P '<filename>,?,?'

6) When you're ready to advertise your server, edit 'mixminiond.conf' and set
   the 'Publish' option to 'yes'.  When you restart your server, it will
   advertise itself to the central directory.

   The first time you do this, your server will not be inserted automatically;
   the directory server holds your server's information separately until I
   confirm it (to prevent pseudospoofing).  Once your server is listed, future
   updates will be get into the directory automatically.

   WARNING: We don't have statistics yet, so the system isn't robust in the
   presence of unreliable servers in the directory.  Please don't publish a
   server if you don't think you can keep it up for a good while.

   {This step will be more automated in later versions.}

To shut down a server:
    mixminion server-stop [-f configfile]

To make a server reload its configuration:
    mixminion server-reload [-f configfile]

    (Right now, this just closes and re-opens the log files.)

Your server can be configured to keep track of the number of packets it
receives and other interesting statistics.  Ordinarily, it aggregates these
totals and flushes a report to disk at a configurable interval.  If you want
to see statistics in the _current_ interval, run:

    mixminion server-stats [-f configfile]

 
VII. HOW TO REPORT BUGS AND SUGGEST NEW FEATURES
================================================

To report bugs, please use the Bugzilla pages at http://bugs.noreply.org.

For other correspondence, please email <nickm@freehaven.net>.

For help in debugging, please try to send a copy of:
        * What command you were running
        * The complete error you got, including stack trace (if any)

If your error occurred on a running server, please make a copy of your
log--it might be helpful.

VIII. FUTURE INTEROPERABILITY
=============================

Mixminion is not yet feature complete.  As the software moves closer to
official release, backwards-incompatible changes *WILL* be introduced.
Future versions of Mixminion, including future versions in the 0.x track, may
reject messages from older versions as additional security features are
added.

Furthermore, the present preview versions include necessary diagnostic
features that potentially compromise anonymity and would be inappropriate in
a production system; these features will be removed or disabled by 1.0.

IX. HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
=====================

Send patches to <nickm@freehaven.net>.  If you can, please submit unified
diffs against the latest version of the code in CVS.

Make sure to run 'make test' before you send in any patches, so you can see
whether your patch broke existing code.  (It's okay if you're not sure how to
fix the test, but please let me know when you send your patch.)
