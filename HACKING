Hacking Mixminion

Requirements:
	Python 2.2 (see PORTING NOTES below)
	OpenSSL 0.9.7 (you'll need to download a snapshot)
	Working /dev/urandom (see PORTING NOTES below)

Setting up:
	Get python 2.2.  There are RPMs around.
	Get the source.
	Unpack openssl 0.9.7 into minion/contrib/openssl.
	cd minion/contrib/openssl; ./config; make
	
Things to try:
	make
	make test
	make time

Things to hack:
	See the TODO list.  It would be really nice if somebody could
	hack up as much of MMTP as possible in C.

DESIGN PRINCIPALS:
    - It's not done till it's documented.
    - It's not done till it's tested.
    - Don't build general-purpose functionality.  Only build the
      operations you need.
    - "Premature optimization is the route of all evil." -Knuth
      Resist the temptation to optimize until it becomes a necessity.

PORTING NOTES:
    - If you need to run on a system without /dev/urandom, you'll need
      to write an acceptable fallback for mixminion.Crypto.trng() to
      use.  
    - We could backport to Python 2.1 with a minimum of pain by
      replacing uses of // with divmod.  We could backport to 2.0 
      (with bigger headaches) by excising nested scopes.

      I refuse to backport to 1.5 or 1.6.

CAVEATS:
    - If I haven't got a test for it in tests.py, assume it doesn't work.
    - The code isn't threadsafe.  It will become so only when it must.
