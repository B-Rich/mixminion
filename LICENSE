XXXX PICK A LICENSE, FOLKS!

Licensing for the Mixminion system 

We haven't picked a license yet.  We should do so before we release
code.  There seems to be the following tensions:
   A) Between wanting universal adoption, and not wanting Microsoft
        embrace-and-extend our server code.
   B) Between wanting a simple, friendly license; and preventing
        people from running modified servers without notice.

Once we get something chosen, it should go here.

Personally, I find the following options most realistic:
1)
   Separate server-only modules from client-and-server modules.  License
   the former under GPL; licens the latter under LGPL.

2) 
   License everything under modified BSD (X11).

I'm still looking at the ARPL as suggested by David Mazieres; it has
some nice anti-Fed features, but its fringeness may scare people off.
Perhaps we can achieve its goals through other means.
