#   This is a configuration file for the mixminion anonymous remailer.  Edit
#   this file, install it in /etc/ (or elsewhere, if you specify a
#   command-line argument for mixminion), and you're ready to go.
#
#   This file format will probably change between now and version 1.0. Watch
#   out.

[Host]

#   Uncomment this line to define a 'secure delete' command to overwrite
#   deleted files.  (This isn't as secure as you think: see the comment in
#   Common.py).
#
#   If you do not specify a value for this option, and we can't find 
#   /usr/bin/shred, we fall back on an internal implementation.
#
#   This is the default command: we just zero out files and unlink them.
#   This choice protects against root (on a non-journaling filesystem), but
#   not against an attacker with deep hardware wizardry and resources.
#
#ShredCommand: /usr/bin/shred -uz -n0

#   Uncomment this line if your system uses a different entropy generator.
#   This file must be a character device that produces a truly random
#   bytestream.

[Server]

#    Location of all mixminion keys and file queues.  You don't need to
#    create this directory; mixminion will do it for you.
#
#    Note that mixminion is fairly strict about its directory permissions:
#    its Homedir below must be mode 700 and owned by whatever uid mixminion
#    runs as, and all directories above the Homedir must be writeable by
#    nobody except mixminion and root.
#
#    Don't worry though: Mixminion should give you helpful error messages if
#    you get this wrong.
#Homedir: /var/spool/minion

#    Location for log file.
#
#LogFile: /var/spool/minion/log

#    Minimum severity of messages to include in log file.  Allowable values
#    are: 'NEVER', 'FATAL', 'ERROR', 'WARN', 'INFO', 'DEBUG', and 'TRACE'.
#
#    Watch out! If you use 'DEBUG' or 'TRACE', the log may contain message
#    that could comprimise anonymity.
#
#LogLevel: DEBUG

#   Change this to 'yes' to make the server echo log messages to stdout.
#
#EchoMessages: no

#   How many bits should the server use for its long-lived 'Identity' keys?
#   Must be between 2048 and 4096.
#
#IdentityKeyBits: 2048

#   How often should the server rotate its public keys?  If you rotate often,
#   you need less storage space for message hash logs, and messages sent
#   using your old keys are less vulnerable to compomise... but if you rotate
#   too often, your server may drop messages that use out-of-date keys.
#
#   You can't rotate keys more than once a day.
#
#   WARNING: In version 0.0.1, automatic key rotation isn't supported.
#
PublicKeyLifetime: 3 months

#   How long after a key rotation should the old key still work?
#   NOT YET FULLY SUPPORTED.
#PublicKeySloppiness: 5 minutes

#   Use this option to define a 'nickname' for this server that users will
#   use as a 'friendlier' version of your identity key.  By default, this is
#   just your hostname.
#
#Nickname: <Insert nickname here>

#   Use this option to define an administrative contact for the remailer.
#
#Contact-Email: relayadmin@your.domain.here

#   Use this field for information that users of your remailer may want to
#   have.  Must be no longer than 1024 characters.
#
#   NOTE: Users will not necessarily see this field before they use your
#     remailer.  
#
Comments: This server has been running Mixminion since version 0.0.1. 
   Of course, since Mixminion is still in alpha (or since we haven't
   edit our configuration file since Mixminion came out of alpha), you
   shouldn't trust us with your anonymity yet.
