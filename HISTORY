----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file lists changes for earlier versions of Mixminion.  For changes
in the latest version, see the README file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW IN VERSION 0.0.3:
   Better build support:
      - Fail more gracefully with missing 'which'.
      - Fail more gracefully with missing python-dev.
      - Portability fixes for Python 2.0.
   Client tweaks:
      - Default connection timeout to 1 minute.
      - Rename stop-server to server-stop.
      - Rename reload-server to server-reload.

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.3rc2:
   Numerous bugfixes, including:
      - More verbose client locking
      - More reasonable log messages
      - Better messages on missing openssl
      - Improved documentation
      - Better support for confused permissions on build
      - Better errors on failing directory retrieval
      - Less verbose description of reply blocks skipped.
      - Base64 encoding should no longer get corrupted by outlook
      - Fix nasty race on queue cleaning.
      - The code compiles (but doesn't run) under cygwin.
   New features:
      - mixminion stop-server and mixminion reload-server commands.

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.3rc1:
   CLIENT:
      - Single-use reply blocks (SURBs) are fully supported and available.
      - You can use client-side pooling: it holds messages until you're
        ready to send them.  Pooling also prevents you from losing
        messages when the first hop in your path is temporarily down.
      - You can now decode binary messages or reply messages from the command
        line.
      - We now time out faster when servers are down.
      - Many error messages are far friendlier.
      - It's now safe to run multiple instances of the client at once.
      - Numerous UI improvements and typo fixes; error reporting is better in
        many ways.
   BUILD:
      - It's easier to build with different OpenSSL installations.
   SERVERS:
      - Servers now have a lightly multithreaded design to prevent extreme
        stalling under heavy loads.  Now the network should remain fairly
        responsive under far more traffic than before.
      - When a message delivery fails, the retry schedule is more reasonable.
        By default, a server will retry an undeliverable message every
        30 minutes for a day, then every 7 hours for 5 days.
      - All modules that use SMTP now set a "X-Anonymous: yes" header.
   CONFORMANCE:
      - We now implement MMTP correctly; before, we didn't accept junk
        packets; handle protocol negotiation right; or do support key
        renegotiation.
      - DROP packets have random payloads.
      - A nasty bug in our implementation of counter mode is fixed.  On
        the bright side, big-endian and little-endian hosts should now,
        finally, be compatible.  On the minus side, we lose backward
        compatibility.
      - Server descriptors and directories now follow a more forward-
        compatible format: we can add sections and entries in the future
        with less risk of breaking existing clients.

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.2.2:
   - Fixed a bug that crashed your server when another server's KeyID was
     incorrect.
   - Add minimal handlers for TERM and HUP signals.
   - Add a disclaimer to main usage message.

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.2.1:
   - BUGFIX: A nasty bug is fixed that could, under just the right
     circumstances, send the server into an infinite loop and fill up your
     hard drive.  If you're running a server, you *should* upgrade.
   - Server log messages are more reasonably structured.
   - setup.py is more clever about half-installed Python.
   - "list-servers" now supports the same directory-download options as
     does "send".

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.2:
   - A real SMTP exit module to relay messages via a local MTA.  Blacklisting
     is supported by address, by username, by host, by entire domain, and
     by regular expression.
   - Integrated directory support for clients.
   - Automatic path selection, along with a better user interface to specify
     paths.
   - You can now enable Cottrell (DynamicPool) and Binomial Dynamic Pool
     batching, though they are disabled by default to make the system more
     testable.
   - Servers resist certain trivial DoS attacks more strongly.  In
     particular, you should no longer be able to send zlib bombs or flood a
     server with open connections.
   - Clean build process under FreeBSD.
   - Ability to run server as a daemon.
   - Slightly better documentation and error messages.
   - Better resistance to newline corruption of server descriptors.
   - Other bugfixes and performance improvements too numerous to mention.

NEW IN VERSION 0.0.1:
   - You can run a rudimentary server that can deliver to other Mixminion
     servers, that can use Mixmaster to deliver to any external address,
     or that sends SMTP directly to a preconfigured set of addresses.
   - You can send anonymous email via these servers.
