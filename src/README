C Source files for Mixminion's cryptography and TLS extension.  Right
now, all of these depend on OpenSSL 0.9.7.  Once NSS supports
server-side DHE, I'd like to do a clean port.

If you're not familiar with writing Python extensions, you should read
"Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter" at
"http://www.python.org/doc/current/ext/ext.html".  Please be aware
that we're trying to keep backward compatibility to Python 2.0,
however, so compare "http://www.python.org/doc/2.0/ext/ext.html" as well.

main.c: functions to initialize the _minionlib Python extension.

tls.c: wrapper functions to expose a minimal subset of TLS to Python.

crypt.c: wrapper functions to expose cryptographic primitives to Python.

_minionlib.h: Header file.
