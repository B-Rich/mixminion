	- lintian thinks /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/mixminion/Main.py is
	  a scrypt and should be +x.  Lintian also complains about the weird
	  shebang (unusual-interpreter).
	  Either define overrides or remove the shebang
	- run server-upgrade on upgrade?
	- teach mixminion that /home g+w staff is fine on Debian.

	upstream issues:
	- give me a mixminiond check-conf which would tell me whether the
	  current config is correct.  Right now if the config is broken
	  (say a bad nickname) mixminiond start will print the error message
	  and the init script will stop.

	  Since I would like to separate config (user) errors from other
	  errors I would like to first check if the config is sane,
	  exit gracefully (0) if not (so that upgrades work).  If then
	  server start fails, the init script should exit with error (1).
