mixminion (0XXXXXXXX) experimental; urgency=low

  * Update debian/copyright: Mixminion relicensed to MIT.  Also, it is 2005
    now.  Update copyright notices.
  * No longer start description synopsis with a capital letter.
  * Most of the error checking in postinst before creating the
    debian-mixminion user is actually rather counterproductive, as adduser
    already does all of the job, only much better.  Therefore comment it out.
  * Increase Standards-Version to 3.6.2 without any other changes.
