Mixminion is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 with the
ammendment given below.  On a Debian system the full text of the LGPL can be
found in /usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL-2.1

Because of the advertising clause of its license, OpenSSL is not
compatible with the GPL.  Thus, we license Mixminion under an amended LGPL:
we explicitly authorize you to treat OpenSSL as a "System Library" for the
purposes of GPL/LGPL compliance.  You may also use Mixminion under an
unamended LGPL; however, if you do so, you may not be able to link it with
OpenSSL.

Future versions of Mixminion may be able to run with NSS or GnuTLS instead of
OpenSSL, thus making this amendment unnecessary.  Patches are welcome.
